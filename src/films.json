Critics have said it is perhaps one of the most moving pieces of musical theatre ever portrayed on celluloid. Unfortunately for them it was filmed digitally",

      "review": "Wonkymotion's first full scale movie making use of many new technical features including, for the first time, Green Screen! The anticipated critical acclaim so desired by all in the production team never actually came to anything. Instead the film was panned.  'Utter dross', 'Painful to watch', 'Where's my supper' and the traditional Eastend cry of 'Leeeve it aaoort' were typical quotes of the time. Hurt and dejected, the crew turned to drink and wanton debauchery. It was a dark time alleviated only by the consumption of large amounts of chocolate.",
